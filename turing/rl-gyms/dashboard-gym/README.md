## Dashboard gym

This is not a gym, but rather a dashboard that can be used to encompass multiple gyms meant to work together. Certain clients can ask for multiple gyms as a package, such as `sales-explorer` (LSN) and `spothub` (Hubspot). This dashboard makes it easier to deliver these as a package and also test the agents in a centralized place.

For more context on the overall `rl-gyms` project, please refer to the root [README.md](../README.md).
