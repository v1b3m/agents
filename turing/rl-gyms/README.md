`rl-gyms` is a project dedicated to creating high-fidelity, interactive clones of complex, real-world websites. These simulated environments are designed to serve as training grounds, or "gyms," for artificial intelligence agents, particularly those using reinforcement learning. The core purpose is to teach these agents how to proficiently navigate and interact with sophisticated web interfaces to accomplish specific goals, mirroring human behavior. This training involves more than just following links; it encompasses multi-step tasks such as logging in, searching for products, filling out forms, and completing transactions in a safe, controlled, yet realistic setting.
