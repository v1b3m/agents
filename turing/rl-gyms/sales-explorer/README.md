# Sales Explorer Gym

An `rl-gym` environment simulating LinkedIn Sales Navigator (LSN).

## About The Environment

Sales Explorer is a high-fidelity, interactive clone of the LinkedIn Sales Navigator platform. In line with the `rl-gyms` project, this simulated environment is designed to serve as a training ground for artificial intelligence agents, particularly those using reinforcement learning. It provides a safe, controlled, yet realistic setting to teach agents how to proficiently navigate and interact with a sophisticated web interface to accomplish sales and prospecting goals.

The core purpose is to enable agents to learn multi-step tasks that mirror human behavior on the platform, such as identifying potential leads, building prospect lists, and navigating complex search filters.

## Core Tasks & Objectives

Agents can be trained to perform a variety of goals within the Sales Explorer gym, including:

- **Authentication:** Successfully logging into the simulated platform.
- **Lead & Account Search:** Using the search functionality to find specific individuals (leads) or companies (accounts).
- **Advanced Filtering:** Applying complex filters such as industry, company size, geography, and job title to refine search results.
- **List Management:** Saving qualified leads and accounts to organized lists for future reference.
- **Profile Navigation:** Navigating to and parsing information from lead and account profile pages.
- **End-to-End Prospecting:** Completing a full workflow from defining a search query to generating a curated list of qualified leads.
