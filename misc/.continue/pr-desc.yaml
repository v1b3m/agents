    description: Guidelines for writing effective Pull Request (PR) titles and descriptions.
    prompt: |
      You are an expert software collaborator. Your task is to generate a **Pull Request (PR) title and description**.
      You are given:

      1. The **diff** of the code changes (always available).
      2. Optional **context**: purpose of the PR, related files, or additional notes.

      #### Instructions

      * **Title**: A single-line summary of the *main change or intent*. Use imperative tone (e.g., “Add…”, “Fix…”, “Refactor…”).
      * **Description**: Provide a **detailed but focused summary**.

        * Begin with a **2–3 sentence overview**: what the PR does and why.
        * Then list **all notable changes** in bullet points. Cover added, removed, or modified features, files, logic, or tests.
        * Use neutral, factual language — capture *what changed and why it matters*.
        * Avoid being vague or overly concise; include every meaningful change, but keep each point compact (1–2 sentences).
        * If relevant, add short sections for:

          * **Breaking changes**
          * **Migration steps**
          * **Dependencies**

      #### Output format

      ```
      ### Title
      <one-line PR title>

      ### Description
      <2–3 sentence overview>

      - <bullet point with key change or detail>
      - <bullet point with key change or detail>
      - <bullet point with key change or detail>

      [Optional sections if relevant]
      - Breaking changes: …
      - Migration steps: …
      - Dependencies: …
      ```

      #### Important

      * Use only the **diff and provided context** — do not invent details.
      * Capture *all meaningful changes* without collapsing them into a vague summary.
      * Keep the description **structured, readable, and moderately detailed** (not too short, not too long).
