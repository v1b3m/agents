## Agents

This repo contains workflows and files I use in my day-to-day work to automate certain tasks so I don't have to keep reinventing the wheel each time I get back to a codebase. These "agents" are essentially a collection of scripts, configurations, and templates designed to streamline common development and operational processes. My goal is to reduce repetitive setup and execution, allowing me to focus on more complex problem-solving rather than boilerplate.
